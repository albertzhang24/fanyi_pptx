# Baidu's Machine Translation API #

### Getting Started with Translate PPTX: ### 

Simple combinations of Baidu’s API’s and freeware can be very powerful. In the case of Baidu's Machine Translation API, you can translate any powerpoint between these [28 languages](https://github.com/albertzhang24/documentation/blob/master/Desktop/documentation_img/REFERENCES.md). Just choose a source to target language option and a powerpoint, and we will take care of the rest!

### An Easy Example ###

Open your terminal, and run **python helloworld_translation.py** to translate "Hello World"!

****************************************************************************************************
### How it Works: ###

* Text Extraction  
    * Using the python-pptx library, the python script searches each slide of a powerpoint for all of its paragraph text runs. 
* Translation process
    * The scipt's _translate function translates the powerpoint's text content by sending a GET request to Baidu's free Univeral Translation API for each text run.  
* Putting it on a Server
    * With [serverless](https://github.com/albertzhang24/documentation/blob/master/serverless_README.md) as the framework and AWS as the cloud provider, we were able to put this service on a server.
