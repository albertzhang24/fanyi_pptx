# Serverless in Baidu's Machine Translation API #

### How it Works: ### 

The serverless framework is combined with the AWS cloud provider to put the powerpoint translation service on a server. First, the user's selected powerpoint gets uploaded to a S3 bucket, in this case mine. Then, the submitter function takes the powerpoint and sends an URL to the serverside translate function. There, the file is stored in the user's /tmp directory and downloaded before getting translated by Baidu's Machine Translation API and sent back to the S3 bucket. Finally, the translated powerpoint is opened in a browser.
